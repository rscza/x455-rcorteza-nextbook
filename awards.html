              <h3>Abdulrazak Gurnah</h3>
              <p>
                The Nobel Prize in Literature for 2021 is awarded to the
                novelist Abdulrazak Gurnah "for his uncompromising and
                compassionate penetration of the effects of colonialism and the
                fate of the refugee in the gulft between cultures and
                continents."<br /><br />
                Gurnah was born in 1984 and grew up on the island of Zanzibar in
                the Indian Ocean, but arrived in England as a refugee in the end
                of the 1960s. He has published ten novels and a number of short
                stories. The theme of the refugee's disruption runs throughout
                his work.<br /><br />

                I first came across the work of the Nobel laureate Abdulrazak
                Gurnah when I was studying for field exams in post-colonial
                literature, in 2009, and what I remember most is the way his
                writing short-circuited my scathing analytical response, which
                had grown to monstrous proportions. At that point in my graduate
                career, I couldn’t get through a page of fiction without
                scrawling a mess of question marks and exclamation points and
                inane comments in the margins. But I sank into “Paradise,”
                Gurnah’s historical novel of colonial East Africa, published in
                1994, like a person who still knew how to read for pleasure. My
                clearest memories of the book have to do with its sensory
                richness, its flashes of eroticism, and the protagonist’s dreamy
                interiority—though the novel’s evocation of a web of
                multilingual communities that are threatened by an encroaching
                colonial monoculture insured that I had lots to note down once I
                picked up my pen again.

                <br /><br />A few years later, I taught Gurnah’s sixth novel,
                “By the Sea,” for a class on post-colonial literature. That
                book, which depicts the fraught relationship between two
                Zanzibari men who reunite in England years after their first
                encounter, fit in perfectly with the course themes of history,
                identity, and memory—but in my own (admittedly imperfect)
                memory, it didn’t teach as well as I’d expected, for reasons
                that are only to its credit. “By the Sea” is long and immersive
                and character-focussed; it’s a novel that asks to be experienced
                rather than argued about.

                <br /><br />When Gurnah won the Nobel Prize in Literature, on
                Thursday, I took the opportunity to blow off my other deadlines
                and read his 2017 novel, “Gravel Heart,” which I chose because
                a) I hadn’t yet read it; b) I was curious about the title; and
                c) it was available on Kindle, and I didn’t feel like tangling
                with the newly Gurnah-curious for what were likely the few
                remaining copies of his work at the Strand bookstore, on
                Broadway. I recommend “Gravel Heart” as a melancholy, evocative,
                and occasionally very funny way to spend an autumn afternoon,
                though I think the Nobel Committee was probably right to name
                “Paradise” as Gurnah’s major work.

                <br /><br />“Gravel Heart” begins with an arresting, somewhat
                deceptive confidence: “My father did not want me,” the narrator,
                Salim, announces in the first line. The reasons behind Salim’s
                perceived loss of paternal love are hinted at in a narrative
                that trips backward and forward in time, and the book often
                seems to wander far from what is ostensibly its central mystery.
                Then Salim’s father returns in the final third to tie the
                strands of the novel together. In Gurnah’s characteristic style,
                the narrative is woven through with what can feel like
                digressions: meditations on photographs, letters, and other
                artifacts; sensory flashbacks, anecdotes, hypotheticals—all the
                scattered aide-mémoire that are relied on by those who are
                displaced. Salim’s father’s story, meanwhile, is told in a
                compelling, propulsive rush. It’s the kind of clean, plot-driven
                tale created by people who have spent their whole lives
                polishing an answer to a fundamentally unanswerable question:
                Why did this happen to me?

                <br /><br />Salim leaves Africa as a teen-ager to live in
                England, where he decides, in the face of strong familial
                opposition, to study literature, and he remains there for most
                of the novel, coming home and confronting his father only after
                fruitlessly contemplating the rift from afar for years. Toward
                the end of the book, after Salim’s father has concluded his
                explanation, Salim asks him, “Did you ever read ‘Measure for
                Measure’?” and, when his father says he’s never fully understood
                Shakespeare (“I could not get past the zounds and exeunts and
                harks and rummage in yonder prologue”), Salim launches into an
                exhaustive plot summary, the point of which is that their
                family’s tragedy mirrors the events in “Measure for Measure” and
                yet his father’s role in their own story is so minor that he has
                no equivalent counterpart in Shakespeare’s play.

              <h3>Piranesi by Susanna Clarke</h3>
              <p>
                Susanna Clarke has won the 2021 Women's Prize for Fiction with
                her novel <i>Piranesi</i>.<br /><br />
                Chair of judges and novelist Bernardine Evaristo, said: "We
                wanted to find a book that we'd press into readers' hands, which
                would have a lasting impact. With her first novel in seventeen
                years, Susanna Clarke has given us a truly original, unexpected
                flight of fancy which melds genres and challenges preconceptions
                about what books should be. She has created a world beyond our
                wildest imagination that also tells us something profound about
                what it is to be human."
                <br /><br />This year, Bernardine was joined by Elizabeth Day,
                podcaster, author and journalist; Vick Hope, TV and radio
                presenter, journalist and writer; Nesrine Malik, Guardian
                columnist and writer; and Sarah-Jane Mee, Sky news presenter and
                broadcaster.<br /><br />

                The Women's Prize for Fiction - one of the greatest annual,
                international celebrations of women's creativity, now in its
                26th year - honours outstanding, ambitious, original fiction
                written in English by women from anywhere in the world.<br /><br /><br />

                <b>About Piranesi:</b><br /><br />

                Piranesi lives in the House.<br /><br />

                Perhaps he always has. In his notebooks, day after day, he makes
                a clear and careful record of its wonders: the labyrinth of
                halls, the thousands upon thousands of statues, the tides which
                thunder up staircases, the clouds which move in slow procession
                through the upper halls.

                <br /><br />On Tuesdays and Fridays Piranesi sees his friend,
                the Other. At other times he brings tributes of food and
                waterlilies to the Dead. But mostly, he is alone. Messages begin
                to appear, scratched out in chalk on the pavements. There is
                someone new in the House. But who are they and what do they
                want? Are they a friend or do they bring destruction and madness
                as the Other claims?

                <br /><br />Lost texts must be found; secrets must be uncovered.
                The world that Piranesi thought he knew is becoming strange and
                dangerous. The Beauty of the House is immeasurable; its Kindness
                infinite.
