                But lately life at ZJ's house is anything but charming. His dad is having trouble remembering things and seems to be angry all the time. 
                ZJ's mom explains it's because of all the head injuries his dad sustained during his career. ZJ can understand that--but it doesn't make the sting

                family traditions and recollections of the glory days, all the while wondering what their past amounts to if his father can't remember it. 
                And most importantly, can those happy feelings ever be reclaimed when they are all so busy aching for the past?"

                multilayered book about a girl determined to fit in and realize her dreams: getting an education, becoming a dressmaker in her father’s shop, and 
                making at least one friend. Acclaimed, award-winning author Linda Sue Park has placed a young half-Asian girl, Hanna, in a small town in America’s 
                heartland, in 1880. Hanna’s adjustment to her new surroundings, which primarily means negotiating the townspeople’s almost unanimous prejudice 
                against Asians, is at the heart of the story. Narrated by Hanna, the novel has poignant moments yet sparkles with humor, introducing a captivating 
                heroine whose wry, observant voice will resonate with readers."
